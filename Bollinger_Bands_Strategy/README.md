# **Bollinger Bands Strategy**

### **What is the Bollinger Bands Strategy?**

Bollinger Bands are a popular technical analysis tool used in stock trading to identify overbought or oversold market conditions. Developed by John Bollinger.

Bollinger Bands are a **volatility-based** indicator that expands and contracts depending on the volatility of the asset. Widening bands show increasing volatility, while narrowing bands show decreasing volatility. This information helps traders assess the risk and potential for price movements and can signal buying or selling opportunities during volatile or consolidating periods.

Bollinger Bands **check volatility** by adjusting the distance between the upper and lower bands based on the asset's price fluctuations. When the market is volatile, the bands **widen**, indicating higher price movement. In periods of low volatility, the bands **contract**, signaling less price movement. This dynamic adjustment makes Bollinger Bands a useful tool for traders to identify market conditions and potential breakout opportunities.

The bands consist of three lines:

1. **Middle Band**: A simple moving average (SMA) of the asset's price, typically over 20 periods.
2. **Upper Band**: Two standard deviations above the middle band.
3. **Lower Band**: Two standard deviations below the middle band.

The key idea is that price tends to stay within the upper and lower bands, and extreme deviations from these bands can indicate buy or sell signals:

- **Buy Signal**: When the price touches or moves below the lower band, it might indicate that the asset is oversold, and a potential buying opportunity exists.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price touches or moves above the upper band, it might indicate that the asset is overbought, signaling a potential selling opportunity.

### **Where and Why Is It Used?**

- **Used in stock, forex, and crypto markets**: It helps traders to decide entry and exit points based on volatility and price movements.
- **Timing trades**: Traders use Bollinger Bands to capitalize on price reversals when the asset appears overbought or oversold.
- **Volatility analysis**: Bollinger Bands widen during high volatility and contract during low volatility, allowing traders to analyze market trends effectively.

### **Key Concepts**:

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The average price over a specific number of periods.
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures price volatility by showing how much the price deviates from the average.
